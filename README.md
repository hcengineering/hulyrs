# Hulyrs

Hulyrs is a Rust library for interacting with various Huly services. It provides a simple and ergonomic API for developers to integrate Huly services into their Rust applications and services.

## Features
- Accounts API
- Transactor API
- Hulykvs API

At the moment hulyrs is in a very early stage of development and it is not really ready for use ouside of the Huly project team. It's API coverage is not complete and covers only functionality which is requred by other Rust based huly services.

Once it will become more mature, it will be published to crates.io and the documentation with example will be provided.
